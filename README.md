  <h1>Django Contact Form</h1>
</div>

<div align="justify">

   Our project is a **"Contact Us Form"** for a website that allows users to contact us by sending a message to our Gmail.

   In addition, to protect against spam, a mechanism has been introduced that limits the number of messages sent to one message every two minutes.

   Form field validation has been performed on the client side, which helps prevent messages from being sent with incorrectly filled fields.

   *Technologies used: Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.*

<br>


<div align="left">

1. Clone this repository

   ```
      git clone https://github.com/lazycatcoder/django-contact-form.git
   ```

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project **'contact-form-django'** folder

   ```
      cd path/.../contact-form-django
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment in the **'contact-form-django'** folder
   
   ```
      python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment

   ```
      source venv/bin/activate   # MacOS/Linux 

      venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

5. Install **Django**

   ```
      pip install Django
   ```

6. Use the console to navigate to the **'contact-form-django\contact_form'** folder

   ```
      cd contact_form
   ```

7. Make migration

   ```
      python manage.py migrate
   ```

8. Navigate to folder **'contact-form-django\contact_form\contact_form'**
and open the **settings.py** file.

   The next step is to fill in some data in **settings.py**:
   
* Generating a new *SECRET_KEY* in **Django**

   ```
      python -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())'
   ```

   This command will execute a Python script that imports the *get_random_secret_key()* function and calls it to generate a new key. The result will be printed in the terminal.

   When you get the new key, copy it and paste it into **settings.py** instead of *SECRET_KEY = ' '*

   ```
      EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'youremail@gmail.com'

   https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
